Welcome to The Book Catalog!

This app is design for a librarian to create, read, update and delete records of library loans from each of the library users.
They can also alter the records of library users and create new ones. 

To take out or return a book, a Book ID number and a Library user ID is required. This is designed to simulate a barcode being scanned and
automatically entered into those fields. 

Afer returning a book, a fine will automatically be generated and assigned to the user and loan record if it is late.

A Gold Member account has a longer loan period and may rack up more fines before they are unable to take out a book.

Enjoy!
